            “What are you so afraid of?” Sasha Jansen, the protagonist of Good Morning Midnight, is afraid of men, but she’s also afraid of women too. She’s afraid of the whole bloody human race. This provocative book balances both humour and tragedy, as Sasha returns to Paris as an older woman finding herself adrift and unable to structure her days around anything except the next place to drink in. A novel that feels incredibly fresh and contemporary despite being written in 1939, the social anxiety and loss which permeate its complexion are enduring themes of the human condition.
