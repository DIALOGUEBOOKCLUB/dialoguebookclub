        <div class="text-container">
            A personal and literary revolution, told through a kaleidoscopic and impressionistic prose as a young Turkish woman fights alone to survive against the oppressive backdrop of nationalism and patriarchy. Recently translated into English for the first time by Maureen Freely, it was awarded the Gregg Barrios Book in Translation prize the month after we read it for Dialogue. Cold Nights of Childhood was the most impactful book I read in 2023 so I was eager to bring more attention to Özlü’s work, and hope to see more of it being translated in the future.
